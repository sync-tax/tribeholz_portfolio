        I was born in Romania, in a small city - also known as Hackerville. You could say I was destined to become a tech nerd... While that's a fun narrative, it's not entirely true. It actually took me quite a while to figure out my path. I've always had diverse interests and hobbies, and I'm glad I took my time exploring them.  Looking back, I can see how those passions led me to the perfect place - where creativity and technology intersect.

      <p>
        I find joy and inspiration all around me—in nature, my relationships, and especially my cats (who are like children to me!). While I'm a sociable person, I also cherish solitude, which allows me to delve into various subjects that fascinate me. 
        
        I express myself through art, design, and code. Some of my favorite ways to spend my time include:

        - Exploring creative coding: Generating visual art with TouchDesigner and algorithmic sounds with Sonic Pi.
        - Sharing my tech knowledge: Creating YouTube videos about tech topics.
        - Expressing myself visually: Drawing, screenprinting, and designing.
        - Gaming and grooving: Immersing myself in the world of Pokémon and dancing to good techno music.

        <h4>Life Philosophy</h4>

      <p>
        In a world that often seems to lack empathy, I believe it's crucial to be respectful and compassionate towards others. While I don't necessarily believe in karma in a religious sense, I do think that cultivating a positive and kind attitude creates a mindset that attracts good things and well-being, rather than negativity and frustration.
