        I was born in Romania, in a small city - also known as Hackerville. You could say I was destined to become a tech nerd... While that's a fun narrative, it's not entirely true. It actually took me quite a while to figure out my path. I've always had diverse interests and hobbies, and I'm glad I took my time exploring them.  Looking back, I can see how those passions led me to the perfect place - where creativity and technology intersect.

      <p>
        I find joy and inspiration all around me â€” in nature, mathematics, relationships, and especially in my cats (who are essentially my children lol). While I'm a sociable person, I also enjoy having time for myself, which allows me to delve into various subjects that facinate me. My hobbies are:  <br> <br>

        - Exploring creative algorithms: Generating visual art with TouchDesigner and algorithmic sounds with Sonic Pi. <br>
        - Sharing tech knowledge: Creating YouTube videos about tech topics. <br>
        - Creating graphics: Drawing, screenprinting, and designing. <br>
        - Gaming and grooving: Immersing myself into fantasy worlds and dancing to bouncy techno music. <br>

      <p>
        In a world that often seems to lack empathy, I believe it's crucial to be respectful and compassionate towards others. While I don't necessarily believe in karma in a religious sense, I do think that cultivating a positive and kind attitude creates a mindset that attracts good things and well-being, rather than negativity and frustration.
