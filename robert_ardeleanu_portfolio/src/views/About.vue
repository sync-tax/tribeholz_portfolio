        I was born in Romania, in a small city - also known as Hackerville. So you could say I was destined to become a tech nerd... lol
        <br>
        ...Actually it took me quite a while to figure out my path. I've always had diverse interests and hobbies, and I'm glad I took my time exploring them. Looking back, I can see how those passions led me to the perfect place - where creativity and technology intersect.

        I find joy and inspiration all around me â€” in nature, mathematics, relationships, and especially in my cats (who are essentially my children lol).
        <br>
        While I'm a sociable person, I also enjoy having time for myself, which allows me to delve into various subjects that facinate me. My hobbies are:  <br> <br>

        - Generating visual art with TouchDesigner and algorithmic sounds with Sonic Pi. <br>
        - Creating YouTube videos about tech topics. <br>
        - Drawing, screenprinting, and designing. <br>
        - Immersing myself into fantasy worlds and dancing to bouncy tekno music. <br>
