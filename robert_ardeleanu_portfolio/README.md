### Personal portfolio of Robert Ardeleanu (TRIBÎžHOLZ)

In terms of the Hypermedia class at the university of applied sciences Hagenberg, I set myself the challenge to build my portfolio as a dynamic and interactive SPA. To archive that I'll utilize:

- Vue.js
- THREE.js
- SASS

- Vite.js (Build)
- Netlify (Deployment)
