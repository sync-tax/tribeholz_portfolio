### Personal portfolio of Robert Ardeleanu (TRIBÎžHOLZ)

In terms of the Hypermedia class at the university of applied sciences Hagenberg, I set myself the challenge to build my portfolio as a SPA using Vue.js.

- Vue.js
- THREE.js
- SASS

- Vite.js (Build)
- Netlify (Deployment)

### Functional Todo's

- [x] Scoped CSS -> SASS (cuz its getting messy)
- [x] Filter Logic
- [x] Collapsable sections
- [x] Project Overview
- [ ] Single Project View
- [ ] Light & Dark coloring (CSS variables -> toggle)
- [ ] Njan Cat Easteregg

### Content Todo's

- [ ] Vectorize Icons
- [x] Decide on Projects
- [ ] Thumbnails

### Canceled (for now)

- Multilayered Filtering (maybe relevant as the amount of projects)
